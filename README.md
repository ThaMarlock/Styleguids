# Style Guides Repository
This repository is dedicated to providing style guides for various programming languages. It aims to cover the essentials needed for clean and maintainable code, including:

- Naming Conventions: How to effectively name variables, functions, classes, etc.
- Structure: Recommended file and project structures.
- Formatting: Guidelines on spacing, bracket use, line lengths, and more.
- Each language section will include:
  - Code Snippets: Practical examples to demonstrate best practices.
  - Tools and Add-ins: Recommendations for tools and plugins that help enforce these style guidelines.
  
Our goal is to support developers in writing consistent and readable code across different languages and projects. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
